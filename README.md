# FMECloudwatcher
FME Cloud Watcher is an attempt at a simple android application to monitor simple stats about a users FME Cloud instances.  

The app will use token credentials to interogate the credit balance, start an instance, or pause an instance using the REST api.  Still figuring out how some parts should bolt together. So stay tuned.
